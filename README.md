### 🔹 **Project 2: Netflix Movies and TV Shows Analysis**

📌 **Description**:
A comprehensive SQL-based analysis of the **Netflix catalog**, exploring trends in content production, genre distribution, and country-wise publishing patterns.

🔹 **Key SQL Highlights**:

* Data Parsing and column splitting (e.g., multiple countries, cast members)
* Date & Duration Conversion for time-based visualizations
* Exploratory Analysis on content types, release year trends, and genre diversity
* String Functions & Filtering to clean and analyze complex fields
* Top N Queries to identify the most featured directors and actors

🛠 **Technologies Used**: MySQL, dbdiagram.io, DBeaver
📖 **Link to Project README**: [Netflix Content Analysis](#)

## 📂 **Getting Started**

To explore any project:

1. Navigate to the relevant project folder.
2. Read the `README.md` for setup instructions and project objectives.
3. Open `.sql` scripts in your preferred SQL IDE.
4. Review data outputs or visualization suggestions (if provided).
5. Run, analyze, or adapt for your own use!

---

## 🛠 **Technologies & Tools**

* 🛢️ **SQL Dialects**: PostgreSQL, MySQL
* 📈 **Visualization**: Power BI, Tableau
* 🧹 **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: SQL Scripts, Window Functions
* 📦 **Database Storage**: Localhost & Sample Datasets (CSV → SQL import)

---

## 📐 **Best Practices in SQL**

* Use **CTEs and Views** for better readability and maintenance.
* Avoid `SELECT *` — specify columns for performance.
* Normalize datasets and use **proper indexing**.
* Follow **naming conventions** for tables and columns.
* Write **modular and reusable queries**.

---

## ⚙️ **Query Optimization & Debugging**

### 🔹 Common Bottlenecks

* Inefficient JOINs → Use **EXPLAIN plans**.
* Full table scans → **Add indexes** on filter columns.
* Repetitive subqueries → Replace with **CTEs** or temp tables.

### 🔹 Debugging Tips

* Break down large queries into smaller parts.
* Use `LIMIT` during testing.
* Validate with **sample outputs** and known totals.
